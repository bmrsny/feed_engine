# Feed Engine

This is a Ruby on Rails application that serves as the back-end and API for
[Up to the Tweet](http://github.com/bryceholcomb/uptothetweet). This was a three
week group project built for the [Turing School of Software and
Design](http://turing.io). The first week and a half was dedicated to building
this RESTful API that the Ember application consumes.
